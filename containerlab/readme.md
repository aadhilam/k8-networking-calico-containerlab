# Lab Setup
This section explains how you can deploy the individual labs for this learning series. 

You need an EC2 instance or VM configured with containerlab. This repo provides a script to provision an EC2 instance with containerlab and other tools. 
ðŸ“– **[Back to Main Labs](../../README.md)** | ðŸš€ **[Deploy Lab Environment](../../README.md#deploying-the-lab-environment)**

If you are using your own VM with containerlab, make sure you have cloned the repo (link below) to this machine prior to going through the rest of the steps in this guide. You will find a folder for each lesson and a `deploy.sh` script in each folder that will provision a lab for that lesson.  

```
git clone https://github.com/aadhilam/k8-networking-calico-containerlab.git
```

The labs typically consist of:

- 3-node Kind cluster (1 control-plane, 2 workers)
- Calico CNI with IPAM enabled
- Pod CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16
- Block size: /26 (64 IPs per block)
- Two multitool DaemonSets (multitool-1 and multitool-2) and an nginx deployment with a cluster-ip service for testing pod to service connectivity

## Deployment

1. **ContainerLab Topology Deployment**: Creates a 3-node Kind cluster using the `lab-name.clab.yaml` configuration
2. **Kubeconfig Setup**: Exports the Kind cluster's kubeconfig for kubectl access
3. **Calico Installation**: Downloads and installs calicoctl, then deploys Calico CNI components:
    - Calico Operator CRDs
    - Tigera Operator
    - Custom Calico resources with IPAM configuration
4. **Test Pod Deployment**: Deploys two multitool DaemonSets for connectivity testing and an nginx deployment with a cluster-ip service for testing pod to service connectivity
5. **Verification**: Waits for all Calico components to become available before completion


Deploy the lab using:
```bash
cd containerlab/[lab-name]
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
# Lab Cleanup

When you're finished with the lab, you can clean up all resources using the automated cleanup script:

```bash
chmod +x destroy.sh
./destroy.sh
```
The destroy script will:
1. **Delete the Kind cluster** (k8s-dns) and all associated containers
2. **Destroy the ContainerLab topology** if it exists
3. **Verify cleanup** by checking for remaining containers and networks
4. **Clean up local files** like generated kubeconfig files
5. **Optionally remove Kind images** (asks for user confirmation)

### (Optional) Manual Cleanup Steps

If you prefer to clean up manually, you can run these commands individually:

### 1. Destroy the ContainerLab Topology

```bash
sudo containerlab destroy -t [lab-name].clab.yaml
```

This command will:
- Stop and remove all containers (Kind cluster nodes)
- Remove virtual network links between containers
- Clean up the lab-specific Docker network
- Remove any ContainerLab-generated files

### 2. Verify Cleanup

Check that all lab containers have been removed:

```bash
# Verify no lab containers are running
docker ps | grep [lab-name]

# Check for any remaining ContainerLab networks
docker network ls | grep clab
```

### 3. Optional: Remove Kind Images

If you want to free up disk space, you can also remove the Kind node images:

```bash
# List Kind images
docker images | grep kindest

# Remove Kind images (optional)
docker rmi kindest/node:v1.28.0
```

### 4. Clean Up Local Files

Remove generated kubeconfig files:

```bash
rm -f [lab-name].kubeconfig
```


**Note**: The ContainerLab destroy command is safe and will only remove resources created by this specific lab topology. It will not affect other Docker containers or networks on your system.
